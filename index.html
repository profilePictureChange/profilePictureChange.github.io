NARRATOR:
...I lay quietly in my bed.
I did not rustle the sheets.
I breathed slowly and silently.
I was listening for a sound I was afraid I'd never hear.
The ringing bells of Santa's sleigh.

DAD:
...you had your water.
Now let's get you upstairs and into bed.
SARAH:
He said Santa would have to fly faster than the speed of light...
...to get to every house in one night. And to hold everyone's presents...
...his sled would be bigger than an ocean liner.
DAD:
there's a Santa.
SARAH:
DAD:
MOM:
...until you're sound asleep, young lady.
Sweet dreams.
DAD:
So go to sleep.

All aboard!
Well? You coming?
Where?
Why, to the North Pole, of course.
This is the Polar Express.
The North Pole?
I see.
Hold this, please.
Thank you.
Is this you?
Yeah. Well, it says here...
...no photo with a department-store Santa this year, no letter to Santa.
And you made your sister put out the milk and cookies. Mm-mm.
Sounds to me like this is your crucial year.
If I were you, I would think about climbing onboard.
Come on, come on, come on. I've got a schedule to keep... Oh.
Suit yourself.

'Cause that's the way things happen On the Polar Express
Hey. Hey, you. Yeah, you. Do you know what kind of train this is?
Huh? Train.
Do you know what kind of train this is? Well, do you?
Uh.... HERO GIRL: - Of course.
It's a magic train.
We're going to the North Pole. KNOW-IT-ALL: - I know it's a magic train.
Actually it's a Baldwin 2-8-4 S3-class steam locomotive...
...built in 1 931 at the Baldwin Locomotive Works. It weighs 456,1 00
pounds and....
Are we really going to the North Pole?
KNOW-IT-ALL:
Herpolsheimer's! Herpolsheimer's!
[KIDS CHEERING]
Wow, look at all those presents. I want all of them.
It's so Christmassy and cozy and beautiful!
CONDUCTOR:
Tickets, please.
Tickets.
Ticket, please.
Try your pocket.
Try your other pocket.
Thank you, sir.
KID:
Thank you, sir.
Uh-uh-uh. That is a public-address microphone. It is not a toy.
KNOW-IT-ALL:
Look what that wise guy punched on my ticket.
"L-E." What the heck does that mean? Next stop, 11 344 Edbrooke.
We're heading for the other side of the tracks.
Page 4/24
CONDUCTOR:
Ah, it's just another pickup.
That's weird. I thought you were supposed to be the last one.
CONDUCTOR:
This is the Polar Express.
Suit yourself.
[WHISTLE BLOWS]
Hey, that kid wants to get on the train.
Come on!
Hurry up!
We have to stop the train.
HERO GIRL:
[GROANING]
Who in the blazes applied that emergency brake?!
He did.
You.
In case you didn't know, that cord is for emergency purposes only.
And in case you weren't aware, tonight is Christmas Eve.
And in case you hadn't noticed, this train is on a very tight schedule.
Now, young man, Christmas may not be important to some people...
...but it is very important to the rest of us!
But... But...
He was just trying to stop the train so that kid could get on.
Hmm.
I see. Young man, is that what happened?
Well....
Let me remind you we are on a very tight schedule.
And I've never been late before...
...and I am certainly not going to be late tonight.
Now, everybody, take your seats, please!
Thank you.
[TRAIN SHUDDERS]
Your attention, please.
Are there any Polar Express passengers in need of refreshment?
KIDS:
[TAP DANCING]
Hot, hot CONDUCTOR: - Oh, we got it Hot, hot Hey, we got it Hot, hot Say,
we got it Hot chocolate Hot, hot Oh, we got it Hot, hot So we got it Hot,

[CHATTER]
You know, Montezuma, the king of the Aztecs...
...would drink 50 quarts of hot chocolate every day.
It was thick as mud and red. He put chili pepper in instead of sugar.
Get it? Hot chocolate? KID: - How do you know? That's not true.
HERO BOY:
I don't think we're to leave our seats. It's a violation of safety
regulations...
...for a kid to cross moving cars without a grown-up.
I think I'll be okay.
Are you sure?
[FOOTSTEPS]
What about this lad in the back? Did he get any refreshment?
HERO BOY:
Well, let's take some to him, by all means.
Watch your step, now. Watch your step.
HERO BOY:
She forgot her ticket.
It hasn't been punched.
Hey, what are you doing? You're gonna get us all in trouble!
[WOLF HOWLING]
[BIRD SPITS]
CONDUCTOR:
I believe I have neglected to punch your ticket.
May I?
I left my ticket right here on the seat.
But it's gone. You mean...
...you have lost your ticket.
She didn't lose her ticket.
I did.
I was trying to return it to you.
But the wind blew it out of my hand.
[SIGHS]
You can have my ticket.
Page 6/24
[CONDUCTOR YELLS]
These tickets are not transferable.
Young lady...
...you will just have to come along with me.
You know what's gonna happen now? He's gonna throw her off the train.
Yeah, he's gonna probably throw her right off the rear platform.
Standard procedure. That way, she won't get sucked under the wheels.
They may slow the train down, but they're never gonna stop it.
Stop it?
That's it! I have to stop the train again.
KNOW-IT-ALL:
HERO BOY:
What happened to them?
Please, she's in big trouble. You have to help me.
Hey!
Hey!
I found your ticket! Wait!
Hey!
Wait!
I have your ticket!
[MAN SINGING INDISTINCTLY]
Is there something I can do for you?
I'm looking for a girl.
A gi...?
[LAUGHING]
Ain't we all?
I have her ticket.
Well, lookie. Lookie here. What is this?
This is an official, authentic, genuine ticket to ride.
Oh, you better keep this in a safe place, young man.
If I was you....
I keep all my valuables right here.
Right here in the old size 1 3.
Experience shows this is the safest place.
Not that I have much use for those.
Tickets.
I ride for free.
Oh, yeah, yeah. I hop aboard this rattler any time I feels like it.
I own this train. Oh, yeah.
It's like I'm the king of this train. Yeah. The king of the Pol Ex.
In fact, I am the king of the North Pole!
Oh, where's my manners? Sit, sit. Sit.
Page 7/24
Take a load off.
Hey, would you like some Joe?
Nice hot refreshment. Perfect for a cold winter's night.
[COUGHING]
There. Bless you.
What about Santa?
Santa? Isn't he the king of the North Pole?
You mean this guy? Huh?
Ho-ho-ho, ho-ho-ho.
What exactly is your persuasion on the big man?
Since you brought him up.
Well, I....
I want to believe.
But... But you don't wanna be bamboozled.
You don't wanna be led down the primrose path.
You don't wanna be conned or duped, have the wool pulled over your eyes.
Hoodwinked. You don't wanna be taken for a ride, railroaded.
Seeing is believing.
Am I right?
But what about this train?
What about it?
We're all really going to the North Pole...
...aren't we?
Aren't we?
Are you saying that this is all just a dream?
You said it, kid. Not me.
Ah.
So let's go find that girl.
One other thing.
Do you believe in ghosts?
Interesting.
HERO BOY:
Wait!
Wait!
I have to wake up.
Yeah. I have to wake up.
Wake up. Wake up. Wake up.
Wake up!
Wake up, wake up. Wake up, wake up!
[WHISTLE BLOWS]
HOBO:
Kid, get your head out of the clouds!
Page 8/24
Wake up, kid!
There's no sleepwalking on the Polar Express.
We gotta jump them knuckles.
Come on, kid. Flip my shoulders.
Grab my lily.
[GRUNTS]
That skirt you're chasing must have moved on ahead.
We gotta hightail it to the hog, pronto. To the hog?
The engine. The engine, you tenderfoot.
We gotta make the engine before we hit Flat Top Tunnel.
How come?
So many questions.
There is but one inch of clearance between the roof of this rattler...
...and the roof of Flat Top Tunnel.
Savvy?
It's just the run up to the hump, kid.
This will be interesting.
[GRUNTING]
Get back on, kid. Hurry!
Grab my muck stick.
[SCREAMING]
There's only one trick to this, kid.
When I say "jump"...
...you jump!
Ah!
You. I thought you got thrown off, and...
You're driving the train? They put me in charge.
The engineer had to check the light. ENGINEER: - Here's the light. Careful.
All right, now.
Oh! Oh! I got it.
[SCREAMING]
How do you know how? It's easy. Come here, I'll show you.
This big lever here, that's the throttle.
This little one here, that's the brake.
And those are the pressure gauges.
And that rope is the whistle.
The whistle. Mm-hm.
You wanna try it?
[WHISTLE BLOWS]
I've wanted to do that my whole life.
[WHISTLE BLOWS]
[SCREAMING]
Hold still! Hold still! Don't move!
Look!
Page 9/24
[SCREAMING]
Stop the train! Stop the train!
Stop the train!
What?
They want us to stop the train.
[GASPS]
Which one is the brake? He told me this was.
Who? The engineer.
The engineer? This one looks like a brake. No, he said this was the brake.
Are you sure?
Uh.... Are you sure?
ENGINEER:
Stop the train!
[SCREAMING]
Caribou?
Ugh. CONDUCTOR:
...without the Polar Express arriving on time.
Am I the only one who understands that?
You. I should have known.
Are you bound and determined that this train never reaches the North Pole?
But look.
Caribou crossing?!
I make that herd to be at least 1 00,000, maybe even a million.
It's gonna be hours before they clear this track.
A tough nut to crack. We are in some serious jelly.
And a jam. Tight spot.
Up a creek. Up a tree.
Lost in the grass. I'll tell you what's grass: our a... Ow!
[CARIBOU WHINES]
[SCREAMING]
[WHINES]
[SCREAMING]
[WHINES]
Problem solved. All ahead, slow.
[GRUNTS]
HERO BOY:
Tell the engineer to slow down.
HERO GIRL:
Watch the speed!
Ah! Jumping jeepers, the cotter pin sheared off.
Page 10/24
What? The pin.
Where? There.
Oh, no. Oh, no.
They can't hear me. They can't? Oh....
CONDUCTOR:
bar.
Is everything all right? What should we do?
Well, considering the fact that we have lost communication with the
engineer...
...we are standing totally exposed on the front of the locomotive...
...the train appears to be accelerating uncontrollably...
...and we are rapidly approaching Glacier Gulch...
...which just happens to be the steepest downhill grade in the world...
...I suggest we all hold on...
...tightly!
[ALL SCREAMING]
The pin. The pin.
[GRUNTING]
Jiminy Christmas, the ice has frozen over the tracks.
Hold on. Hold on. No, no.
Come on. Watch your step.
Come on, sweetie. Up you go. Up you go.
Shh. Put your feet on here. On here.
CONDUCTOR:
Young man, quick thinking on your part.
Step to your left, please. To your left.
Oh!
Well, that is more like it.
What in the name of Mike?
[CRACKING]
Look.
Get us the blazes out of here!
Turn this sled around.
Look there.
Tracks.
Dead ahead.
Right.
Left.
Right.
Hang a Louie.
Toss a Ritchie.
Port astern.
Page 11/24
To the starboard.
HERO BOY:
It's not my ticket, it's yours.
It's my ticket? Yes.
Right. Keep up with me. Left.
Right. Left.
Right.
Left.
Right.
Left. Right.
Oh, no! Oh, no!
Brace yourselves!
Well, that's more like it.
Thank you.
Thank you. I can't believe you found my ticket.
Did someone say they found a ticket?
Well, in that case.... Tickets, please.
[COUGHS]
Thank you.
HERO GIRL:
CONDUCTOR:
Tricky walking up here. It's mighty slick. Mighty slick, I tell you.
Oh, whoop... There you go. What did I tell you?
Years ago, on my first Christmas Eve run, I was up on the roof making my
rounds...
...when I slipped on the ice myself.
I reached out for a hand iron, but it broke off. I slid and fell.
And yet, I did not fall off this train.
Someone saved you?
Or something.
An angel.
Maybe.
Wait. Wait.
What did he look like? Did you see him?
No, sir. But sometimes seeing is believing.
And sometimes the most real things in the world are the things we can't
see.
Ah, the forsaken and the abandoned.
Mind your step, now. These poor toys have suffered enough...
...being left to rust and decay in the back alleys and vacant lots of the
world.
Page 12/24
What are they doing here?
It's a new concept the boss came up with.
Instead of being thrown away, they're collected. Refurbished.
He calls it "rebicycling." Something like that.
HERO GIRL:
...seeing toys that were treated this way.
CONDUCTOR:
...string puppets and marionettes...
...pose a particular problem. We found the nimble fingers of our work
force...
...here at the North Pole are best for working out those knots and tangles.
Thank you. Uh-oh. Double-locked here.
You are just like me, my friend.
A scrooge! Ah!
Ebenezer Scrooge.
North Pole, Santa Claus, this train...
...it's all a bunch of humbug. A bout of indigestion.
Oh, yeah. I know what you are.
You're a doubter.
A doubter. You don't believe!
You're a doubter! You don't believe!
[KIDS LAUGHING AND CHATTERING]
Hey, you missed it. We rode down some really sharp hills.
We were on what looked like a frozen lake.
But I know it was just an optical illusion caused by moonlight.
He said the train was on ice. But I said that's impossible...
You can't put a train track... Hey, where you going now?
[INDISTINCT SINGING]
Shh.
LONELY BOY [SINGING]: I'm wishing on a star And trying to believe That even
though it's far He'll find me Christmas Eve I guess that Santa's busy
'Cause he's never come around I think of him when Christmas comes to town
The best time of the year When everyone comes home with all this Christmas
cheer It's hard to be alone Putting up the Christmas tree with friends who
come around It's so much fun when Christmas comes to town Presents for the
children Wrapped in red and green All the things I've heard about But never
really seen No one will be sleeping On the night of Christmas Eve Hoping
Santa's on his way When Santa's sleigh bells ring I listen all around The
herald angels sing I never hear a sound And all the dreams of children Once
lost will all be found That's all I want when Christmas comes to town
That's all I want when Christmas comes to town
Look.

HERO BOY:
CONDUCTOR:
We just crossed it.
And do you see? Those lights in the distance.
They look like the lights of a strange ocean liner sailing on a frozen sea.
There...
...is the North Pole.
KIDS:
through The mountains and the snow You can ride for free and join the fun
If you just say yes
'Cause that's the way things happen On the Polar Express whoo, whoo, the

[MARCHING FOOTSTEPS]
CONDUCTOR:
Two columns, if you please.
Shorter in the front, taller in the rear.
Even-numbered birthdays on the right, odd-numbered on the left.
No pushing. No pushing. But let's not dilly-dally.
It's five minutes to midnight.
Page 14/24
Hey, what gives? It was five minutes till midnight four minutes ago.
Exactly. Columns of two.
One, two. HERO GIRL: - Excuse me.
Question. What about him?
No one is required to see Santa.
Ladies and gentlemen, you do not have to hold hands...
Come on. ...but please remain in your columns...
...while we are in transit.
Look, you have to come with us. She's right.
Christmas just doesn't work out for me. Never has.
But Christmas is such a wonderful, beautiful time.
It's a time for giving and being thankful, for friends and family.
People hang decorations and lights. Santa leaves presents under our
Christmas trees.
Christmas just...
...doesn't work out for me.
Look, I don't know if Christmas is gonna work out for you or not...
...but this is Christmas Eve. Don't stay here by yourself.

All I found was one present. All it had was stupid underwear.
Look.

At your convenience, of course.
It's still five to. I think we're gonna make it.
Of course we will. It's been five to for the last hour.
We got plenty of time. We got nothing but time. We got time to kill.
HERO BOY:
I may be just an old railroader...

Yes, indeed.
The first gift of Christmas!

This bell is a wonderful symbol of the spirit of Christmas...

CONDUCTOR:
Remember to eat the five basic food groups.
Ticket, please.
And please brush after every meal.
[GROANING]
CONDUCTOR:
All right, you. Ticket, please.
"Lean." Whatever that's supposed to mean.
"Lean" is spelled with four letters.
I believed I punched five.
Hey, are you saying I don't know how to...?
Oh, I'm sorry. It says "learn." My mistake.
Lesson learned.
Ticket.
CONDUCTOR:
Sure is.
So can you count on us to get you home safe and sound?
Absolutely.
Me...
...and my friends.
Ticket.
It says "lead." Like "lead balloon."
I believe it also is pronounced "lead."
As in "leader," "leadership."
"Lead the way."
Follow you anywhere, ma'am.
Ah, yes.
Young man with all the questions.
Ticket.
It says... Don't...
It's nothing I need to know.
Come on, let's see the bell. GIRL 1: - Let's see it.
BOY 1:
KNOW-IT-ALL:
It's gone.
Page 22/24
BOY 2:
I lost the bell from Santa's sleigh.
BOY 3:
LONELY BOY:
We'll... We'll find it. BOY 4: - Yeah, we'll find it.
Yeah, we'll help you. All of us.
Yeah, let's hurry out and find it right now.
[TRAIN CHUGGING]
It's too late.
Gee, that's really too bad.
Really.
I'm sorry.
CONDUCTOR:
Next stop, 11 344 Edbrooke.
Hey, where you going?
Home.
Oh, okay. Merry Christmas.
Thanks for stopping the train for me.
Have a wonderful Christmas.
Watch your step, please.
And merry Christmas.
Look.
[TRAIN SHUDDERS]
Santa got to Billy's house already.
Look, look! Santa got here!
Isn't that amazing?
It is amazing.
It is amazing.
I'm sorry about the bell.
It was a really special present.
Well, you know what they say.
It's the thought that counts.
Yeah.
Well, see you.
Well...
...see you.
See you.
Watch your step, please.
Thank you.
No, thank you.
One thing about trains:
Page 23/24
It doesn't matter where they're going.
What matters is deciding to get on.
CONDUCTOR [MUFFLED]: Merry Christmas!
What?
Merry Christmas!
Wake up. Wake up. Santa's been here. Santa's been here.
Hurry up. Hurry up!
Mom, Dad, wake up. Wake up!
Santa's been here! Santa's been here!
Mom, Dad, look! He brought us all kinds of stuff!
Look, a train!
SARAH:
ever.
Wait. Look.
Here's one more.
Has your name on it.
[BELL RINGS]
[BELL RINGS]
SANTA:
Better fix that hole in your pocket.
Mr. C.
[BELL RINGS]
MOM:
Santa. Santa?
Really?
Oh, that's too bad. DAD: - What's this?
Broken. Huh?
Sorry about that, sport.
[BELL RINGS]
MOM:
NARRATOR:
But as years passed, it fell silent for all of them.
Even Sarah found, one Christmas, that she could no longer hear its sweet
sound.
Though I've grown old...
...the bell still rings for me.
